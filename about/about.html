      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Established in 2008, Moonlight International School was created to provide a warm and nurturing start for children from 3 months to 6 years. Our vision has always been to blend Ghana's rich cultural heritage with modern early childhood practices. Over the years, we have grown into a trusted preschool, known for our caring teachers, engaging learning experiences, and child-friendly facilities that help little ones shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with just a few little ones, our preschool has grown into a warm and welcoming community for children. We blend the rich values of Ghanaian culture with nurturing early childhood practices that meet global standards. Our focus is on providing a safe and caring environment where children can explore, play, and learn. With creativity, curiosity, and confidence at the heart of our approach, we help every child take joyful first steps toward a bright future.
